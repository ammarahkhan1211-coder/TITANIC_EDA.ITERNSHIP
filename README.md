# TITANIC_EDA.ITERNSHIP
 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overview
This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover patterns and factors that influenced passenger survival.

Objective

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify relationships between features such as gender, class, age, and fare with survival outcomes.

Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

Key Insights
> Females had a higher survival rate than males.
> First-class passengers survived more often than lower classes.
> Higher fares were linked to higher chances of survival.
> Age and gender played major roles in determining outcomes.

 Deliverables
- Titanic_EDA.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- Titanic_EDA_.pdf → Summary report of findings
